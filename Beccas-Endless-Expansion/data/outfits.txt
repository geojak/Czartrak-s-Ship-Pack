	description "This special barrier was first built just after the Raiders started attacking the Hai, but they never became popular because back then it was just a way to slow down the enemy boarders. Later on a Pulse Rifle was added to the base model making it much more useful, but they never gained success since the outfit space they take, even if it's not much, prevents a pilot from installing a large number on a ship without removing some components."

	description "A few hundreds of years ago, the northern anarchists didn't have access to any heavy generator except the RTI-I model, but with the increase of the ship systems power need they were starting to suffer of low energy more and more often. Their situation got better when one of the few manufacturers on their worlds developed a larger and more space efficent version, but they soon found out it creates more heat than the previus model."
