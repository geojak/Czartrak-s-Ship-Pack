	description "The Korath Seedship was originally built as a exploration vessel for their colonization programs. It is controlled mainly by AI, but has enough bunk space for a extra crew of five. The thing that makes this ship special are the integrated scanners, ramscoop systems, and a Cryogenics Bay that can hold up to 100 colonists in stasis."
	description "Korathi colonization missions have slowed to a near halt, so nowadays the remaining Seedships are used as autonomous reconnaissance battalion."
	description "The advanced integrated scanner package allows the scanning of planets, asteroids, and potential threats."

	description "The Crow is a modified Tarazed Blackbird. It was created by a rogue Tarazed engineer who was on the verge of being fired. Apparently he liked watching Samurai-Anime more than doing his job. This inspired him to turn the popular transporter into a lightning fast striking warship with two added gun ports at the front, reinforced hull plating and extra shield emitters all over the hull. To fit the extensive modifications most of the passenger bunks and cargo space were converted."
