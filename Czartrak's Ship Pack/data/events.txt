			`As you walk through the Spaceport you notice an uncommonly high interest in an advertisement about the newest development from Syndicate Shipyards. You stop at a local bar with a large video screen, which just so happens to be playing the advertisement. You start watching.`
			`	On screen a large Pirate Fleet has blown multiple ships to shreds until two large Syndicate Security ships appear. At first you wrongly mistake them both as Vanguards, but as the camera moves closer you notice that one is much larger. The Syndicate ships open fire on the Pirates and just a few seconds later there is nothing left but space debris.
