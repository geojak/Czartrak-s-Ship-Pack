			`As you walk through the Spaceport you notice an uncommonly high interest in the newest Syndicate Advertisement. You stop at a local bar with a large video screen, which coincidently also plays the Syndicate Commercial. You start watching.`
			`	On screen a larger Pirate Fleet has blown multiple ships to shreds until two large Syndicate military ship appears. At first you wrongly mistake them both as Vanguards, but as the camera moves closer you notice that one has a much larger size. The Syndicate Ships opens fires on the Pirates and just a few seconds later there is nothing left but space debris.
