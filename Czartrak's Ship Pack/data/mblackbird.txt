	description "The Tarazed Blackbird was originally design to be a high-class passenger transport. Evidently this ships previous owner had something else in mind with it. It has been heavily modified to be a lightning fast striking warship with two added gun ports at the front and extra shield emitters and hull plating all over the hull. To fit the extensive modifications most of the passenger bunks and cargo space were converted."
